* Crypto analysis of the Vigenere Cypher
+ (The Kasiski method) Using the Index of Coincidence of the cypher n-th letters for different lengths of keys (for a key of size 4, for example, every 4th letter will have been encrypted with the same letter) we can find the most likely length of the key
+ Once we 'know' the length (n) of the key, the n-th letters of the cypher text will be a Caesar cypher, which can then be decoded using frequency analysis.
